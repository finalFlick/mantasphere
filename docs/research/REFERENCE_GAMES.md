# Reference Games Index (What To Learn + Where It Maps)

These are **synthesized design notes** derived from the research PDFs in this folder. They are intended as a searchable reference for future implementation and design discussion, not as verbatim excerpts.

## Scope

This is an index of commonly referenced games from the research, organized by **what they do well** and **which MantaSphere systems it maps to**.

## Index

| Game | What to learn | Maps to |
|------|--------------|---------|
| Hades | Curated challenge modifiers (“pact/heat”), boss pacing, readable telegraphs | [CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md](CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md), [BOSS_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md](BOSS_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md) |
| Brotato | Between-wave shop cadence, large character roster with strong identity, sequential difficulty tiers | [PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md](PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md), [CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md](CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md) |
| Vampire Survivors | Evolutions, reroll/banish controls, horde density management, content discovery pacing | [BUILD_AND_SYNERGY_SYSTEMS.md](BUILD_AND_SYNERGY_SYSTEMS.md), [PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md](PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md) |
| Risk of Rain 2 | On-kill chain identity, late-game chaos scaling, boss “build exam” patterns | [BUILD_AND_SYNERGY_SYSTEMS.md](BUILD_AND_SYNERGY_SYSTEMS.md), [BOSS_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md](BOSS_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md) |
| 20 Minutes Till Dawn | Synergy upgrades with prerequisites, difficulty ladders, “tome” style trade-offs | [BUILD_AND_SYNERGY_SYSTEMS.md](BUILD_AND_SYNERGY_SYSTEMS.md), [CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md](CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md) |
| Soulstone Survivors | Deep meta trees, curse stacking, ability replacement/pivoting | [PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md](PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md), [CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md](CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md) |
| Slay the Spire | Seeded daily runs, drafting/pool management, clear run modifiers for competition | [CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md](CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md), [PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md](PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md) |
| Dead Cells | Daily challenge scoring, persistent upgrade pacing without trivializing early content | [CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md](CHALLENGE_AND_DIFFICULTY.md), [PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md](PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md) |
| Rogue Legacy | Unlock-tree pacing, run-to-run variety via character traits | [PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md](PROGRESSION_AND_ECONOMY.md) |
| Gunfire Reborn | Encounter pacing and boss rhythm in a run-based structure | [BOSS_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md](BOSS_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md) |
| Jetboard Joust | Movement-driven enemy patterns and readable swarm pressure | [ENEMY_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md](ENEMY_DESIGN_RESEARCH.md), [ARENA_EVENT_CONCEPTS.md](ARENA_EVENT_CONCEPTS.md) |

## How to Use This Index

- Use it as a **design citation map** when proposing a new system.
- If a feature proposal needs justification, link to one of the research markdown files above and reference a game here as an existence proof.
